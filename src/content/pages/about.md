## Personal Projects
I like to explore and try new technology, technical things, and do hands-on myself. For this purpose, I have my own playground - kailaba. Though, initially kailaba (काईलाबा) is started as [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@official.kailaba) to share book summary in Nepali language, it has now grown to website, and is my playground to test anything I want ;)

- **<a href="https://kailaba.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kailaba</a>**  
  I write articles, manage overall website from SEO to development.

- **[EL Computer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kailaba.computer)**  
  I have had a dream to have my own app published on Play Store, and to see it installed on some other user's phone. EL Computer accomplished that dream through me.

- **[EL Computer Web](https://elcomputerweb.kailaba.com/)**  
  [@Nabin](https://github.com/IBA4) daily complained me to publish it in app store. I was poor to pay 100$ per year for per app, so I deployed it's web version so that Nabin can use it. No doubt, you can use it too ;).

## Outside of Work
I enjoy teaching, writing, and sharing. These are the place where I share:
  - **<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ShivaGyawali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiva Gyawali YT</a>**  
  I share useful videos for students, from (hard engineering) course content to some travel vlogs, some useful information and scholarship tips, and many more. Check it once.

- **[काईलाबा YT](https://www.youtube.com/@official.kailaba)**  
  I read books (or, books read me?). And, I share it to the Nepali audiences in Nepali language.
