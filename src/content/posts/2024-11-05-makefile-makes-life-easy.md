I am new to Makefiles. I only know "make" and sometimes without knowing I have executed "make && make install". Now, it's the time that I must know what's going on when I do "make", there comes the Makefile into the picture.

* [Makefile Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/)





I will add below anything I found noteworthy points or remarks to consider.



Happy learning...!!!
