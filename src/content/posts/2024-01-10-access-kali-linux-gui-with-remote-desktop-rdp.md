Hi Learners,



In this article, we are going to setup Remote Desktop acess to the Kali Machine. 

Just for out of curiosity, I wanted to access kali VM in my another laptop from other laptop. To set the things up, we need to install remote desktop server on Kali machine, and enable it to accept remote desktop client.
