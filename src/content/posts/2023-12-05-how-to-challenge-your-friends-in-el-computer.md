Hey all, Preparation and learning grows exponential when it is linked with friends, and some challenge. 

EL Computer embarks on this fact, and let you challenge and play game with your friends. In this article, I will show you how you can do so.

There is small oversight in the app, that random room code generated includes digits and letters, however, input box only accepts digits. We need to do some trick to overcome this, a minor bug from usðŸ˜‰

### Step1: Battle, create room, and share the code

First of all go to home section of app, and click on 1 v/s 1 Batte, then the popups to create room and joining room appears. Then:

* Click on 1 v/s 1 Battle
* Click on Play with friends
* On create pane, choose chapter, and create coins to bet.
* Click on Creating
* Room is created, and a room code is generated. Share the code with your friend.

### Step 2: Copy, and Paste the code

Battles begin once your friend joins the room. So, ask your friend to copy the code you have sent, and then paste it over the Join room pane, on code box. 

* **Share** it via any feasible medium, it can be messenger, text message, or simply viber.
* Ask you friend to **copy it.**
* Friend will click on **1 v/s 1 battle** on Home section, then, chooses **Join pane** on the popup window.
* Then he/she will **paste** the copied room code to enter there.
* Click on **JOIN ROOM**

Banggg,, you are now entered into the room of your friend. Wait till he/she will start the game.

### Step3: Start the game, and banggg

Once your friend is connected to your room, now, its the time to play the bangg challenge with your buddy. Let's click on Start button.

Once you click on Start, now you both will be directed to Challenging quiz mode, where you both will be shown equal number of questions, and equal time. The one who answer correct more questions, will win all the coins, and another will loose.
