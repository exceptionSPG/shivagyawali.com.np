Hi guys,

In this tutorial, I am guiding you to integrate any template to Codeigniter project. For this article, We will use NOVA Template. Please download it.

## Codeigniter download and install

Download Codeigniter starter project from [Codeigniter download page.](https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/downloads.html) We will be using [Codeigniter3.1.10](https://codeload.github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/zip/3.1.10)

Download it, extract, and place under **/var/www/html/codeigniter-starter** Or C://xampp/htdocs/codeigniter-starter/

After extracting, you can visit **http://localhost/codeigniter-starter/,** You will see the page looks like below:

![Codeigniter starter](/assets/codeigniter-starter-webbrowser.png "Codeigniter starter output")

Now we are ready to go.

Open the codeigniter-starter folder in vscode.

```
cd /var/www/html/codeigniter-starter
# open the codeigniter-starter folder in vscode.
code .
```

### Directory and Files Hierarcy overview

Codeigniter has its own unique way of implementing MVC framework. It has following directory and files heirarchy:

![Codeigniter files and directories.](/assets/codeig-files.png "Directories and files in Codeigniter")

There are many files under these folders. However, mainly we will work in application directory and its subdirectory. Some important files under these directory are shown in the above diagram.
