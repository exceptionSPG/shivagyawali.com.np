## Personal Projects
I like to explore and try new technology, technical things, and do hands-on myself. For this purpose, I have my own playground - kailaba. Though, initially kailaba (काईलाबा) is started as [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@official.kailaba) to share book summary in Nepali language, it has now grown to website, and is my playground to test anything I want ;)

  A web platform designed to [briefly describe what the platform does, e.g., connect users with local services, facilitate online bookings, etc.]. My role involved [mention your contributions, such as development, design, or specific technologies used].

- **[EL Computer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kailaba.computer)**
